Working for Transact Pro, Sergey proved himself as a professional developer, able to work both on existing projects support and new systems development. Being a fast learner, Sergey rapidly became one of our most skilled developers, evolving from fresh graduate in a very short term.

Mostly back-end developer, Sergey showed strong skills in front-end, devops, and also participated into our raspberry pi cluster building.

I was also impressed by his skill to explain his concepts, ideas and solutions to other team members - and check that others got his idea.

Sergey definitely would be valuable member to any team.
