I've been working together with Sergey on multiple systems integration projects and successfully delivered.
As a team, it has always been a great pleasure working with him.
He's resourceful and well experienced full-stack solutions architect who never fails in providing solutions and professional consulting service (from front-end/backend solutions, mobile technologies, stretching to infra/cloud related topics).
He's a quick thinker and a person who takes the initiative and actions to make things happen / achieve things in timely manner.
His out-of-the-box thinking and technical recommendations are spot on and his contribution to the projects that we have been working on can be easily seen and felt.
He's such a valuable asset for the team and we shall create more success stories in future.
