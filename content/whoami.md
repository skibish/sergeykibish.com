I'm a creator with a Master of Computer Science degree :mortar_board: (I'm proud of this :tada: :tada: :tada:), Software Developer at [Transact Pro](https://transactpro.lv) and [GDG Riga](https://gdgriga.lv/) Organizer.

I have some [open source projects on GitHub](https://github.com/skibish) that are used/stared by others:

- [DDNS](https://github.com/skibish/ddns): [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/skibish/ddns.svg)](https://github.com/skibish/ddns/stargazers) featured on [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go) and is rocking :rocket:

- and others: experiments, university stuff (many students use this stuff ðŸ¤“), workshops, etc.

Also, I have some closed "in-house" projects that may be published in the future or discussed in some blog posts.

I'm a person with an interesting / creative vision on things. If you give me space to breath â€” I will come up with cool ideas and solutions.

I'm in web technologies and everything that surrounds them (and there is a lot, almost everything). Because they give us:

- :trophy: more opportunities
- :books: more things to discover
- :alarm_clock: more time to save
- :rainbow: open new horizons

I'm happy to be part of tech-world.

I like to work with cool people (who doesn't? :sunglasses:). I like to share knowledge (you can find some of my [presentations here](https://speakerdeck.com/skibish)) through the talks or workshops.
