I'm Master of Computer Science 🎓 (pointing this out, because I'm proud of this 🎉🎉🎉), Software Developer at [Transact Pro](https://transactpro.lv) and [GDG Riga](https://gdgriga.lv/) Organizer.

I love ❤️ technology very much. Do with it a lot of different things. Have some [open source projects on GitHub](https://github.com/skibish) that are used/favorited by others:

- [DDNS](https://github.com/skibish/ddns): [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/skibish/ddns.svg)](https://github.com/skibish/ddns/stargazers) featured on [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go) and is rocking 🚀

- and others: experiments, university stuff (many students use this stuff 🤓), workshops, etc.

Also have some closed "in-house" projects that may be published in future or discussed in some blog posts.

I can say that I’m a developer in different ways, not only in software. I like to imagine things and then build them.

I think, I'm a person with an interesting / creative vision on things. If you give me space to breath — I will come up with cool ideas and solutions.

I'm passioned about web technology and everything that surrounds it (and there is a lot, almost everything). Because it gives to us:

- 🏆 more opportunities
- 📚 more things to discover
- 🕰️ more time to save
- 🦄 open new horizons

I'm happy to be part of it.

I like to work with cool people (who don't? 😎). I like to share knowledge (you can find some of my [presentations here](https://speakerdeck.com/skibish)) as a talk or through workshops.

If you would like to know more about my vision / thinking – [ask me 🔮](#contact).
