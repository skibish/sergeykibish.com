about: |
  Software Engineer with 10 years of experience in tech (mainly fintech and insurtech).
  I create clarity where there was confusion/chaos before.
  I am an expert in listening to customers, understanding their needs and requirements.
  I make clients happy by solving problems in the simplest ways possible.

  I'm walking the path of the Jedi.
  I started as a young padawan and grew into who I am now, fighting with illogical and unneeded complexities.
  Along the way gathered hard skills in the backend, DevOps, Cloud, QA, frontend and a little bit of mobile.
  As a true Jedi, I've learned to manipulate abstractions (boxes and arrows).
  I have an ability to identify the customer's needs and pain points.
  I mentor peers and lead by example.

  In my next endeavor, I aim to leverage my experiences to help build great teams that can create products loved by many. I will define the vision and serve as the voice of the customer when communicating with others.

  Additionally, I would be delighted to represent you at developer conferences, events, hackathons, and with the technical press and educational blogs.
