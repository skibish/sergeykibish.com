"Wow, I have not thought about this" --- told me one of the colleagues.
Golang is a sobering language that refreshes your view on doing things.
It shifted our mindset about the usual flow of application development and now there is no way back.
During this talk speaker will share his experience of migrating from OOP style applications to the Golang.
How view on doing things shifted through time and how it changed development. He will talk about success, struggle and mistakes.
After this talk it will be easier for you to convince your friends/colleagues to move to the Golang.
