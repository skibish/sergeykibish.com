Interviewing potential candidates is hard.
It is even harder if you donâ€™t have a proper interviewing process.
And even harder if you are not a manager, but a software engineer.
You start by using intuition and whatever you think is best.
This approach might work, but it is too chaotic and will eventually fail.

Interviewing more than 200 potential candidates in a 5-month period is a lot.
You will hear how interview process evolution was made from nothing to the process that works in terms of speed, scale, and quality.

And of course, you will learn some useful tips for resume-building and going to interviews, too!
