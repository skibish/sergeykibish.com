It's like System Design interview but much more fun and interesting!
Gameified session during which app will be designed live, together with everyone in the room.

You will solve interesting challenges moving from level to level which grow in complexity.

Game shows how idea transforms from initial, just a thought into something sustainable before implementation.

It shows:

- Importance of having conversations between business and IT on early stages
- System evolution when requirements change, business scales
- Ideas from where to start implementation to make it faster to MVP
- And how fun it can be!
