Lets explore the Universe of IT.
Let's see what it's made of!
We will start from the web, server-side, going toward clouds and talk how they are made and what are the challenges.

Then we will continue with discovery of our pocket devices, smart houses, embeddable devices (Internet of Things) and the Future (VR/AR, etc.)
