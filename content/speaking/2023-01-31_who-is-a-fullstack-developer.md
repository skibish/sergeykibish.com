In the constantly evolving world of technology, there are many different roles and titles that make up the field of engineering.
But among them all, there is one that seems to evade easy definition - the Full-Stack Engineer.

What exactly does it mean to be a Full-Stack Engineer?
Is it a jack-of-all-trades, able to handle any task thrown their way?
Or is it a title reserved for only the most elite and highly skilled engineers?

In this talk, we'll take on the role of detective and set out to uncover the truth about Full-Stack Engineering.
Using a combination of observations, assumptions, and careful conclusions, we'll explore the various skills and responsibilities required to truly be a full-stack engineer in today's tech industry.
