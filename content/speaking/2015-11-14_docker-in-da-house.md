Have you ever thought about minimalistic workspace?
Without spending hours to install all needed things for successful development? You want to develop in "close to production" environment locally?
And share this environment with other team members easily?
You know what?
It's easy to do, especially when Docker comes in the house!

I will tell you a little what is Docker, how you can easily spin up NGINX + PHP + Database + Whatever (e.g. node, gulp, bower, ruby+sass, etc.) without installing ANY of these on your host system.
Good practices, examples of real life use cases.
All this accompanied with a live demo.
Join the dark side, we have Docker :)
