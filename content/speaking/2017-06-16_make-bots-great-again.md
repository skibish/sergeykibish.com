You already heard about different tools and platform to create bots, like [Hubot](https://hubot.github.com/), [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/), you name it.

During the Google I/O there were interesting announcements about AI and specifically around [Google Assistant](https://assistant.google.com/), [Actions on Google](https://developers.google.com/actions/), and not so much about [API.ai](https://api.ai/) which can change the way how you think about bots.
After this talk you will get the idea, how to create cool bots with API.ai, integrate them with Slack, Google Assistant, and other different services.
And it will be served with live demo.
