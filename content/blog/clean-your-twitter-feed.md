  Why to keep all of those tweets in a feed if they are not relevant anymore?

There are many people on Twitter who tweet and tweet, and tweet...
But [the lifespan of those tweets is very small](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-lifespan-of-a-tweet), 18 minutes, few days maximum.

Twitter is mostly consumed in the current moment.
It works for quick consumption of news and to do the announcements.

With very low probability you will go back in time to search some specific tweet to repost it.
Maybe, if you are the journalist and work with celebrities and like to play the game "but you said this 4 years ago".

Some time ago I've build a tool to clean the Twitter feed and keep it always fresh: [twitter-cleaner](https://github.com/skibish/twitter-cleaner).

If you want to clean your feed too, you now know that there is a tool for this.

Enjoy!
