During my work duties I need to generate AAD (Azure Active Directory) tokens to verify various things.

This exercise is not simple: requires multiple steps usually when I want to get it done in one go.

So, I've build [a tiny tool named **aadtoken**](https://github.com/skibish/aadtoken) for this task which you can use too!
