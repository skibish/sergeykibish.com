Sometimes I write music.
Music is part of me and one of the best friends who follow me throughout life.
I started my acquaintance with music by listening to it, then through piano, DJing, drums and percussions.

Now I explore how to write music in different genres using DAW and what is available now.
During this new exploration I found that I want to share my music with wider audience.
Here you can find my singles, albums and playlists.
