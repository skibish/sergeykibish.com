I think Sergey is an outstanding engineer and solutions architect with lots of experience building systems and solving technical challenges.
Also, he's really good at talking to people who need to understand the technical stuff but don't speak the same language.
This combination is rare in our industry.

We teamed up on a tough project that had lots of politics and tech challenges, and Sergey did an amazing job getting everyone on the same page and leading us to success.
Sergey is absolutely great at working with others and making sure everyone gets along.
