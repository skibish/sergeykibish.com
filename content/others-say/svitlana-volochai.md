Very knowledgeable and super-efficient is what comes to my mind when I think about Sergey. I’ve had the pleasure of knowing Sergey for 12 months between 2020 and 2021 when we were closely working together on implementation of an automated underwriting solution for one of the biggest insurer in Asia-Pacific. Sergey played a leading role on the technical side of the implementation.

I was impressed with his knowledge and his ability to quickly adjust to client’s needs and to handle daily requests from the client very efficiently and fast. Also, the client was impressed with the way Sergey worked and on multiple occasions has expressed his gratitude for Sergey’s excellent support.

Sergey is easy to work with and he will be a true asset to any team or any challenging project opportunity.
