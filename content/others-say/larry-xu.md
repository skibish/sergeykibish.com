I have had the pleasure of working with Sergey while he was the Senior/Lead Solution Architect on one of our recent innovative projects in 2022, where I was in charge of the overall project delivery.
His ability to solve complex problems with simple and elegant solutions clearly demonstrates his mastery of the modern software architecture discipline.
What makes Sergey an outstanding architect and an exceptional individual is his skillful application of various design patterns to real world scenarios and his authentic and trustworthy personality.

Sergey demonstrated excellent leadership through his support and guidance to other team members during the project.
He set the code foundation and DevOps standard with a quality first mentality.
His contributions and leadership earned well-deserved recognition from the team and the project stakeholders.
I highly recommend Sergey for future innovative and transformational software projects.
