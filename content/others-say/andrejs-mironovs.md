Sergey is a full-stack developer, great public speaker and colleague I was happy to work with.
I would describe his work as "precise" — thought-out, carefully implemented and always in-time.
Sergey is a person for whom learning is a part of lifestyle.
As active member of GDG Riga group he doesn’t hesitate to share his knowledge publicly.
Sergey is a great team-player — responsive, reliable, ready to help and open for constructive critics.
