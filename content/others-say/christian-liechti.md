I worked with Sergey on various projects across Asia over the last 3+ years.
His problem-solving skills, client centricity and technical knowhow are very impressive.
I personally enjoy working with Sergey as he is very open minded and capable of explaining complex background so that non-tech people (like myself) are able to understand.
He is very curious and interested to immerse himself into new areas and new challenges.
I have received very positive feedback from our clients on how Sergey is managing complex projects/situations and contributing in a relevant and meaningful way.
