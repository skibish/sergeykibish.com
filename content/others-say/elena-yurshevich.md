I know Sergey since 2014.
We met at my lectures about Computer Methods of Data Analysis under the Bachelorâ€™s program of Computer Science.
Further he continued to study in my disciplines connected with the Artificial Intelligence and Intellectual Data Analysis in Master study program in the field of Computer Science.
Also I have been a scientific supervisor of his master thesis, that was brilliantly defended in 2017.

The topic of this thesis was Anomaly Identification in the Dynamic Environments Using Methods of Advanced Analytics.
For all the time of our acquaintance, I watched his personal and professional growth.
He demonstrated brilliant analytical abilities, well-founded knowledge of theoretical basis in the Deep Learning, Advanced Analytics and ability to use them correctly and creatively in practice using modern tools.

It should be noted that Sergey is able to quickly master new knowledge and skills in limited time period.
Writing his master work, Sergey demonstrated abilities and skills of time management, the ability to correctly set tasks, stress resistance, ability to plan and manage the processes, independence and ability to present the results in front of the audience on scientific and professional conferences completely and systematically.

He is distinguished by a systematic and careful approach in the organisation of his work, and by ability thoroughly and accurately solve the problems.

Definitely Sergey has become a high-quality specialist in the field of Data Science and Advanced Analytics and will certainly be able to demonstrate his profound knowledge and professional skills as a specialist in the relevant fields.
