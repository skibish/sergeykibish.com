Sergey was our scrum master in a mobile application project we did at PROMAND 2014 in Poland.
Not only excelling in management tasks, he also rolled up his sleeves to join us in developing and testing the app and proved to be a good developer as well.
Not only did he work hard, but he also knew the right tools to work smart and productively as well.
Sergey is a self-motivated, reliable, knowledgeable and responsible person.
I heartily recommend Sergei and would be too happy to work with him again.
