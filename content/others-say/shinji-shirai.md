Sergey is the dream architect & developer for every project manager!

Over one year ago, I met Sergey and had a chance to work with Sergey in one of the projects in Asia, which I was temporarily assigned as an overall project manager.
Although after I stepped down from the project manager role, the project manager involved me in the project from the sideline.

Imagine projects in Asia; it does not always work like in the West.
It does not mean wrong but merely different.
Even this difficult to manage the environment, Sergey stands out, not only thanks to his technical capability but always with an easy way to explain for everyone to comprehend.
Sergey still maintained his calmness during some of hectic as well as some critical issues popped up.
He played a vital role in the success of this project.

Besides the project work, I also had a chance to know a bit more about the personal side of Sergey.
He is open and not complicated at all, and we had a lot of fun together.

In any projects, especially if they are challenging ones, every project manager would be lucky to have Sergey in your team!
