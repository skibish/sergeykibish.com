Sergey was one of our best master student and with high-estimated Master Thesis. Very motivated, ability to learn and with excellent communication skills. By my opinion, he has very strong ability to work in a interdisciplinary environment and ability to incorporate existing knowledge. He has good potential in R&D. Very Intelligent and open-minded.
